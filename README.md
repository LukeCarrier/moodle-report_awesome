Report: awesome
===============

Reporting has been a topic discussed with a great deal of interest over the
last few months in the Moodle community. This project is my attempt at
building a powerful, user-friendly reporting platform.

Bugs, bugs everywhere
---------------------

This is a toy project. It's ~~probably~~ ridiculously unstable. I might move on
to the new hotness and leave you in the lurch (but I probably won't). Please
don't install this plugin on your production sites just yet!

Envisioned features
-------------------

* Configurable reports, a la Totara report builder
* Graphing query results using YUI 3's chart module
    * Some kind of server-side fallback with GD/IMagick
* Some kind of extensible API for sources, one source class per logical "object"
* Probably a whole bunch of other stuff I haven't thought about yet
